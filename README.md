## Lessons Learned

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Dynamic Schedules**: Building a student reminder app addressed the challenge of frequently changing class schedules, ensuring students stay updated.

2. **Real-time Updates**: Firebase Realtime Database enabled instant schedule updates, improving communication between administrators and students.

3. **Admin Control**: An admin app provided a convenient platform for administrators to manage schedule changes efficiently.

4. **Database Choice**: Switching from Firestore to Firebase Realtime Database resolved asynchronous update issues in the client app.

5. **User Feedback**: Incorporating user feedback throughout development helped refine features and ensure the app meets user needs.

6. **Adaptability**: The app's design prioritized flexibility to accommodate future schedule changes, ensuring its long-term relevance.


## Optimizations

1. Minimize Data Transfer: Reduce unnecessary data transfer between the client and server by only fetching essential schedule updates rather than the entire dataset.

2. Client-side Caching: Implement client-side caching to store frequently accessed data locally, reducing the need for repeated database queries and improving app responsiveness.
